# Face Blur 😵‍
This is an application that blurs out human faces from a group of bulk input images or videos

## Results
Here's a sample input image:

<img src="/input/test-roselia.jpg" alt="An image of the band Roselia" width="300"/>

And this is the expected output:

<img src="/output/test-roselia.jpg" alt="An image of the band Roselia" width="300"/>


## Usage
1. Place your images in the `input` folder
2. Run the following command
`python main.py`
3. The images with blurred faces should appear in the `output` folder

## Note
As of now, this can only detect phases from select photos and misses faces that are in any weird positions or angles
